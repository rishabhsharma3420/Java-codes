The Internet is&#10;actually a global network of networks Millions of computers are able to share information with each other&#10;using the telephone lines In fact the Internet links at least 3 million computers at any one time and that&#10;does not count the people logging on just to surf the net It only counts the institutions providing some type&#10;of Internet service or information sharing programs"/>
